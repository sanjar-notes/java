# 3. Anonymous Class
Created Thursday 13 August 2020

We have two types of anonymous classes.

1. For an existing class
2. For an existing interface


#### Syntax
	COI_name p = new COI_name(); // no class - normal
	COI_name p = new COI_name(){/*class code here*/}; // anonymous class



* The anonymous class block is meant to be an extension(extends) or an implementation(implements) of a class or interface, respectively.
* We can even skip the whole intiation if need be.


	(new Object(){/*code*/}).method(); // works
	
	(new Object(){
		public void hello()
		{
			System.out.println("Hello there");
		}
	}).hello();


**Note** - We still have parenthesis in the syntax before the brace begins.
