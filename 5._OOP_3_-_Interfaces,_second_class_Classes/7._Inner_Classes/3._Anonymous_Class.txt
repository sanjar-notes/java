====== 3. Anonymous Class ======
Created Thursday 13 August 2020

We have two types of anonymous classes.
1. For an existing class
2. For an existing interface

=== Syntax ===
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
COI_name p = new COI_name(); // no class - normal
COI_name p = new COI_name(){/*class code here*/}; // anonymous class
}}}


* The anonymous class block is meant to be an extension(extends) or an implementation(implements) of a class or interface, respectively.
* We can even skip the whole intiation if need be.

{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
(new Object(){/*code*/}).method(); // works

(new Object(){
	public void hello()
	{
		System.out.println("Hello there");
	}
}).hello();
}}}


**Note** - We still have parenthesis in the syntax before the brace begins.
