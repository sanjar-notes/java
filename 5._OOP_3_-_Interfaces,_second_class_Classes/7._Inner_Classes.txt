====== 7. Inner Classes ======
Created Friday 07 August 2020

* It is possible to **nest** a class inside another in Java.
* There are 4 types of nested classes:
	1. Static nested class - only for packaging convenience.
	2. Non-static nested. There are 2 types:
		a. Nested member class - aka inner class.
		b. Local class - a class inside a block scope.
		c. Anonymous class - class without a name.
* Nested classes are packages in their containing class instead of the package.
