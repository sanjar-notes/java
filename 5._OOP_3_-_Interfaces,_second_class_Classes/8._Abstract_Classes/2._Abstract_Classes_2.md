# 2. Abstract Classes 2
Created Saturday 08 August 2020

**Idea**

* Birds can fly, so can Bats and Dragonflies. We have a problem here...
* Should we have a FlyingAnimals class?
* Better, we should remove the fly() from the class Bird and make an inteface called canFly.

*****

Rules:

* We can [skip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/197893/why-an-abstract-class-implementing-an-interface-can-miss-the-declaration-impleme#:~:text=As%2C it is not important,in interface without implementation here.) implementation of an interface if we are an abstract class.
