====== 3. Encapsulation 1 and 2 ======
Created Monday 03 August 2020

* It is the mechanism for enforcing restrictions, i.e achieving abstraction.
* We are not talking about security, but of access(Classes outside of the current class cannot change class components anyway).

Encapsulation solves two problems:
1. Voids the chance of inadvertent changes from the programmer - access is cut off
2. Reduces the impact of change. We can change the inner code, while the interface remains the same.

Extras:
1. We can validate input.
