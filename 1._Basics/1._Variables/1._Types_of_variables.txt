====== 1. Types of variables ======
Created Tuesday 05 January 2021

In Java there are four types of variables:
* Non-static fields - variable belonging to an object
* Static fields - variable belongs to a class
* Local variables - declared inside a method
* Parameters - passed to a method as argument

* There are no global variable in Java. Everything is under a class. Static variables are used as 'global' variables.

=== Declaring variables ===
There are two types of declarations:
1. Without initialization - applicable only for fields(null) and parameters
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
type varName; // fields - set to 'null'
void f(int x) // parameters
{}
}}}

2. With initialization - applicable to all except parameters(as they are initialized in the function call)
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
type varName = value; // works for primitive types and their autoboxed versions
type varName = new ClassNam(); // for objects
}}}


Note: 
* From Java 10 onwards, [[https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/05/25/simplify-local-variable-type-definition-using-the-java-10-var-keyword/#:~:text=In Java 10%2C the var,t need to declare that.|type inference]] is allowed in Java using the ''var'' keyword. But the behavior is mostly carpicious(a won't fix RFE). It's not even close to C++20's super cool ''auto'' keyword.
* Variable initialization is a **must **in Java. Automatic initialization to ''null'' is only for class fields.
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	Car p; // error - 'variable not initialized'
}
}}}


=== Rules for naming - will give errors ===
* Variable names are case sensitive
* Allowed symbols are numbers, alphabets(both cases), underscore and dollar symbol.
* First letter of the name cannot be a number.
* Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names.

Sum up: C++ rules + dollar can be used.

=== Conventions ===
Contants - all caps and //[[https://medium.com/better-programming/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841|snake_case]]//(i.e underscore for spaces)
