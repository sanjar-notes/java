# 2. Try with resources
Created Sunday 16 August 2020


* Sometimes, we need a try block even if no errors will be thrown. Examples include, opening files, connecting to a database etc. 
* The try with resources is a new(from Java 8 onwards) syntax to automatically close resources when the try block exits(either successfully or by exception).

Syntax:
	try(File myObj=new File("wdhkwbd"))
	{}
	catch(){};


* We can have multiple statements, separated by semi-colon.

	try(FileWriter loc_file = new FileWriter("locations.txt");
		FileWriter loc_file = new FileWriter("locations2.txt"))
	{
		String[] messages = ["Get Here", "I'm good","Go east"];
		for(String msg: messages)
			loc_file.write(msg + "\n");
	}
	catch(IOException e){}
	// file is automatically closed, null close exception, if there, is suppressed
