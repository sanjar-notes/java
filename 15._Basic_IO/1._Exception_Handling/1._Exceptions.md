# 1. Exceptions
Created Tuesday 11 August 2020

Exception - an event which disrupts the normal flow of the program.


* Using exceptions is not a rule of thumb.
* Using exceptions generates less code - the motivation to use exceptions.



* The exception is propagated throug the stack, until some activation record handles it.
* Keep code less inside a try catch block


*****


* To **throw** - create an exception object and use the throw keyword
* All exceptions have an overloaded constructor that takes a string.

	throw new ArithmeticException("attempt to divide by zero"); // message using e.getMessage()


*****

**Multi-catch exception**
	try
	{
		// code 1
		// code 2
	}
	catch(/*code 1 exception*/){}
	catch(/*code 2 exception*/){}
	// works like a switch case


* Keep the ones down more general then the top one. Exception is the most general.
* There is another way to catch potential multiple exceptions - but they will be treated in the same way - Java 8 feature

	catch(ArithmeticException | NoSuchException e) //bitwise OR
	{}


*****


* Start try after normal statements, otherwise the variables might go out of scope in the catch and finally blocks.


*****

using **finally**

* The finally block(if present) is executed for a try-catch irrespective of whether an exception was thrown or not.
* finally runs even if the try-catch has return statements.
