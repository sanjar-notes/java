# 2. Visibility
Created Sunday 09 August 2020


* Access modifiers are not defined for everything everywhere:
	1. For members - private, protected, protected, public, default(nicknamed package-private)
	2. For top level classes and top level interfaces - public, default
* Why do we need them? They help in encapsulation.

![](./2._Visibility/image.5ISIO0.png)
MAID â†’ All access modifiers focus on one thing and one thing alone.

* interface methods are always public.
* interface variables are always public, static and final


This is so stupid, but it's okay because I don't care.
