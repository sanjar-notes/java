* Access modifiers are not defined for everything everywhere:
	1. For members - private, protected, protected, public, default(nicknamed package-private)
	2. For top level classes and top level interfaces - public, default
* Why do we need them? They help in encapsulation.

MAID â†’ All access modifiers focus on one thing and one thing alone.
* interface methods are always public.
* interface variables are always public, static and final
