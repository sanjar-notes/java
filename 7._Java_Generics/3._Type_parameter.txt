====== 3. Type parameter ======
Created Sunday 09 August 2020

[[./generic_classes_using_type_T/src/Team.java]]
Syntax:
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
public class Team<T>
{
	// use T somehow, but not directly
}
}}}

* We can also restrict the values T can take: These are called bounded type parameters. This syntax works only for the subclasses of Player.
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
public class Team<T extends Player> // sets upperbound for the value T can take
}}}

--------------------
* The argument for the class can be a class or an interface
* Interfaces can also have type parameters
* We can have multiple bounds
* Syntax for multiple bounds - ampersand
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
public class<T extends Player & Coach & Manager>{} // Class first, then interfaces
// Coach and Manager are interfaces implemented by T here
}}}

--------------------
* Comparable is a useful interface
--------------------
We can have multiple type parameters too:
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
public class Team<U extends Player, T extends Team>{
}}}

The declaration/instantiation would be:
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
Team<FootallPlayer, Team<FootballPlayer> k = new Team<>();
}}}
