# 6. Comparing types
Created Thursday 07 January 2021

There are many ways to work with types.

1. ``instanceof``
	* Syntax: It has a non functional syntax.
	* Requires both variables to be defined at compile time.

	int p = 2, 1 = 3;
	boolean k = p instanceof q; // true
	Class.forName(c).isInstance
	
	

* Follows [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle). Will return true if a subclass is matched against a parent class.
* Returns true if ``p`` implements interface q.
* Returns ``false`` if p or q are ``null``.


2. ``isInstance`` - <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/instanceof-operator-vs-isinstance-method-in-java/>
