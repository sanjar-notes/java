# 3. Type parameter
Created Sunday 09 August 2020

[./generic_classes_using_type_T/src/Team.java](./3._Type_parameter/generic_classes_using_type_T/src/Team.java)
Syntax:
	public class Team<T>
	{
		// use T somehow, but not directly
	}


* We can also restrict the values T can take: These are called bounded type parameters. This syntax works only for the subclasses of Player.

	public class Team<T extends Player> // sets upperbound for the value T can take


*****


* The argument for the class can be a class or an interface
* Interfaces can also have type parameters
* We can have multiple bounds
* Syntax for multiple bounds - ampersand

	public class<T extends Player & Coach & Manager>{} // Class first, then interfaces
	// Coach and Manager are interfaces implemented by T here


*****


* Comparable is a useful interface


*****

We can have multiple type parameters too:
	public class Team<U extends Player, T extends Team>{

The declaration/instantiation would be:
	Team<FootallPlayer, Team<FootballPlayer> k = new Team<>();
