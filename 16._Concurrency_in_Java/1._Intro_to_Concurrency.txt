====== 1. Intro to Concurrency ======
Created Wednesday 12 August 2020

* **Process** - A unit of execution that has its own memory space
* Each instance of Java runs as a process
* Process and applications are generally used interchangeably
* Heap memory isn't shared between Java processes, each have their own.
--------------------
* A **thread** is a unit of execution within a process.
* Threads for a process share resources like files and memory of the process.
* **Thread Stack **- In addition to the process's heap, each thread has got its thread stack.
--------------------
Why do multithreading?
There are two reasons:
1. To utilize CPU when tasks pause for some resource
2. An API wants us to provide one
* Concurrency - Tasks don't need to fully complete, in order for other tasks to start
* When doing concurreny, we are at the mercy of the JVM and the OS. Outputs for the same code can vary for different machines because of this.
