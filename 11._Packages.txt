* Java packages are a mechanism to group Java classes that are related to each other, into the same "group" (package). This is crucial for large codebases where abstraction is vital.

**Definition** - A Java package is like a directory in a file system. In fact, on the disk a package is a directory. 

=== Filesystem details ===
* All Java source and class files of classes belonging to the same package are located in the same directory.
* Java packages can contain subpackages. Java packages can thus make up what is called a package structure. 
* A Java package structure is indeed organized as directories on your hard drive, or as directories inside a zip file (JAR files).

=== Features of a package ===
* Classes within a package have unrestricted access to one another.
* It handles namespace and access protection.
