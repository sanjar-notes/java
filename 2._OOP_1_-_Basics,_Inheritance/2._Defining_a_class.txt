====== 2. Defining a class ======
Created Thursday 07 January 2021

* Classes(at least top-level) must be defined in their own file.
* Name of the file must be ''topLevelClassName.java''
e.g ''Car.java''
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
public class Car
{
}
}}}


=== Fields ===
* Classes store data in fields. These fields may be any object, including of the same class.
* They reside in the class but outside any function(including constructors).
* Fields can do any computation that ''return''s a value for their initialization.
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
public class Car
{
	public String a = "1" + ((Integer)2).toString(); // This is valid
	
	// This is an error, returns nothing
	if(true)
	{
	}
}
}}}
