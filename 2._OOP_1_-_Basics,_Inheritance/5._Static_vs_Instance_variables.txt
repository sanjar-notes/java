====== 5. Static vs Instance variables ======
Created Monday 03 August 2020

**Static variables**
* There's only one set of static variables, shared by all the instance of the class.
* They are set to trivial variables, if uninitialized. No need of inline etc like in C++, as Java allows for variable initializations inside the class but outside functions.
 
**Instance variables**
* All non-static variables are instance variables.
* Each instance has it's own copy of instance variables.
* They are set in the constructor, but can be outside of it as well.
