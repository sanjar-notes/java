# 2. this vs super
Created Sunday 02 August 2020


* **super** is used to access/call the parent class members(variables and methods). super is mandatory when calling an overriden parent function inside the same named function.
* **this** is used to call the classes' own fields and methods. It can be omitted if it has not ben overshadowed(e.g by a parameter).

Note: 

1. When chaining constructors, the call **this**() or **super**() must be the first statement.
2. When inheriting, the Java compiler calls super() without the args, in the constructor, if no super constructor calls are present.
3. A constructor can call either this() or super() **but not both, both cannot at the first line at the same time.**
