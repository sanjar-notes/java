# 2. Defining a class
Created Thursday 07 January 2021


* Classes(at least top-level) must be defined in their own file.
* Name of the file must be ``topLevelClassName.java``

e.g ``Car.java``
	public class Car
	{
	}


#### Fields

* Classes store data in fields. These fields may be any object, including of the same class.
* They reside in the class but outside any function(including constructors).
* Fields can do any computation that ``return``s a value for their initialization.

	public class Car
	{
		public String a = "1" + ((Integer)2).toString(); // This is valid
		
		// This is an error, returns nothing
		if(true)
		{
		}
	}
