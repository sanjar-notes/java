# 5. equals and hashCode override
Created Monday 10 August 2020


* The default == checks equality of reference, equals() checks bit by bit value.
* There is a strict relationship between hashCode and equal, i.e if two objects have the same value, they should have the same hashCode.
* Signatures - Important

	
	public boolean equals(Object obj); // between this and obj
	public int hashCode(); // for this
	


* Use the Override annotation
* Examples of equals and hashCode


	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj)
	{
		return this.name.equals(obj.getName()); // String.equals is called here, which is implemented by default
	}



*****


* All the primitive types have **equals** and **hashCode** already implemented properly, use them.
* To make equals invincible for subclassing, make the Override equals() **final**.
* equals has to be a equivalent relation - reflexive, symmetric and transitive
