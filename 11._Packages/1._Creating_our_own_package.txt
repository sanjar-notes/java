====== 1. Creating our own package ======
Created Sunday 09 August 2020

=== Steps for making a package ===
1. Make a folder(name should be same as package name). Name it **rootDir**
2. Write the classes inside this folder.
3. Each class must have **package rootDir.curdir;** on top of it.
	e.g If the **rootDir** is itself the packges, then package declaration will be ''package rootDir;''
The directory is now a package.

=== Details ===
* Classes within a package can freely access each other, assuming proper modifiers are used.
* Packages may be nested to any depth. The rules remain the same.
* Name of the package directory starts from the root directory.
