# 7. Connecting to the DB
Created Sunday 16 August 2020

To connect to the DB and do basic queries, do the following:
	import java.sql.Connection;
	import java.sql.DriverManager;
	import java.sql.ResultSet;
	import java.sql.SQLException;
	import java.sql.Statement;
	
	try
	{
		Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:test.db");
		Statement statement = conn.createStatement();
		statement.execute("SELECT* FROM contacts");   //
		ResultSet results = statement.getResultSet(); // or results = statement.executeQuery("QUERY...");
		conn.close();
		statement.close();
		results.close();
	} catch(SQLException e)
	{}


There are three resources here:

1. Connection - the connection
2. Statement - we write statements here
3. ResultSet - we read the results from this object, row by row



* We perform the queries using the execute() method. We get back the result using the statement.getResultSet() method. One query, one result is the rule followed by the result.
* We can use the statement.executeQuery() to directly get back the ResultSet
* The result is seldom queried by the field name, it is mostly queried by the index, because names can change.
* We need to close all 3 resources, make it a habit to close or use try-with-resources.
* We can write functions to avoid repetitive work.
